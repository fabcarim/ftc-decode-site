## Objective
Understand the two main robot modes and when to use each one.

## Simple explanation
- **TeleOp** is driver-controlled. Humans tell the robot what to do.
- **Autonomous** is pre-planned. The robot runs a script by itself.

## Code snippet
```java filename=ModeNotes.java
// TeleOp: read gamepad, drive the robot.
// Autonomous: run steps without gamepad input.
```

## Practical exercise
Look at your robot setup and list three tasks you do in TeleOp and one task you could automate.

## What to submit
- A short list of TeleOp tasks (3 items)
- One Autonomous task idea
